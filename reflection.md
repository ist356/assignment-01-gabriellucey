## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

After completeing Assignment 1 I learned how to use all of the visual studio code features for testing code. I now understand that when running tests the test stops once one of the tests fails. I was a little confused on how the debugger worked but I think once I use it with more complex code I can understand it more. When creating the code for the numbers dictionary I needed a refresher on how to use while loops and appending so I used Github Copilot to help me write the code. I knew that I needed a loop that continued but I forgot about the break function which stoops the loop and I also forgot that if I want to keep inputting values I need to use a while loop instead of a for loop. However, when using Copilot I noticed that it pretty much gave me all the code which is useful but it is important that when I use it I am understanding all the code that it gives me. Overall, I did not struggle with this asssignment but may need more practice with the debugging tool as it will be helpful for more complex code where I cannot see the error myself.
